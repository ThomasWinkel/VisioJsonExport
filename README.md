# VisioJsonExport
JSON export that follows the Visio object model.
Allows you to process a document without a Visio application.

The export does only contain specific data like:
- User defined cells
- Properties
- Connections

The export does not contain common data like:
- Regular ShapeSheet cells (positions, colors, etc.)

In future we can extend data as reuired.
